	  	      <p>LES is a neighborhood that has been popularized only in recent years. The divde between LES and Chinatown is blurry, and you&#39ll see here the ghettoness of Chinatown mixed in with trendy places that cater towards younger folks who have money to spend. There are tons of bars at a more reasonable price than Meatpacking and often with more character as well.</p>

  	  	      <p>Hotel Chantelle is known for its nighttime activities and dance floor, which can get a little grungy at times, but in the day they serve a nice rooftop brunch with live jazz at an affordable price. Bottomless drinks are something around $6 (which scares me), but it&#39s a great environment for a group brunch!</p>

  	  	  	  <h3>Back Room<br><small>#speakeasy #historic</small></h3>
  	  	      <p>Of all the speakeasys in NYC, this one is my favorite because it is a real speakeasy from the age of Prohibition. The picture that I&#39ve posted is the actual entrance, which is made more conspicuous because there is usually a random guy standing by the gate (to check IDs). Cocktails are served in tea cups (because it&#39s an establishment that doesn&#39t serve alcohol, remember?!) and occasionally they&#39ll have live Big Band music and swing dancers.</p>

  	  	  	  <h3>Apotheke<br><small>#speakeasy</small></h3>
  	  	      <p>While Back Room has the authenticity, Apotheke probably has the best looking front because it&#39s hidden deep in Chinatown. What you&#39ll see about the inside is really nothing you&#39d expect from the outside, and all the cocktails are pharmacy themed. They have a pineapple one that&#39s very tasty!</p>

  	  	      <p>If you&#39re ever missing home, you can try this place perhaps (even though there is a pretty real looking version of Hofbrauhouse in Midtown East that you probably wouldn&#39t want to go to). In any case, it&#39s a nice place to sit outside for a drink and is in a neighborhood that is a little more quiet.</p>
