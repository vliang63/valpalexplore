  	  	  	  <h3>Ippudo<br><small>#ramen</small></h3>
  	  	      <p>By and far the most famous ramen place in New York City (yes, this means more lines). The food and atmosphere should speak for itself, even though I still think that $15 for a bowl of noodles and soup is pretty pricey. Also try their Chao Shao buns, which are also popular with most people. I&#39ve heard of one way to avoid the usually unavoidable 1 hr wait (although I haven&#39t tested it): they don&#39t usually take reservations, but if you have the time to walk in during lunch hour, I heard that you may be able to make a reservation. You should do more research on this one though!</p>

  	  	  	  <h3>Mighty Quinn<br><small>#bbq #sogood #casualeats</small></h3>
  	  	      <p>One of Seb&#39s favorite places when he visited NYC, Mighty Quinn is probably the second best BBQ I&#39ve ever had, and you can get it casually. There is usually a line, but it goes pretty fast. I&#39d recommend the brisket (but that&#39s just because I really like beef). All of the food is delicious and make sure you try all of their free pickled miniside things.</p>

  	  	      <p>A speakeasy located close-ish to Union Square. I haven&#39t been since the lines have always been long, but you can (and should!) make a reservation in advance. I&#39ve heard great things about it.</p>
