	  	  	<h2>Neighborhood Lowdown</h2>
	  	      <p>Hipster town - the complete opposite of Meatpacking! Where poor artists used to live - now unaffordable for real hipsters, Williamsburg exudes the eclectic atmosphere of luxury hipster resulting from the combination of art+weirdness+money. I love this neighborhood and was thinking about moving there, given I stayed a bit longer, and most of my European friends were big fans too. Note: there are some non-Williamsburg Brooklyn places that are mentioned as well - I&#39ll be sure to point those out.</p>

There are weird things like Ramen Burgers (noodles as the bun for a burger 0_0..not really my thing) but also the best of the BEST when it comes to coffee, donuts, BBQ, innovate cheese cakes, etc.</p>

  	  	  	  <h3>Brooklyn Bridge<br><small>#engineeringmasterpiece #pizza #skylineview</small></h3>
  	  	      <p>If you are going to walk the Brooklyn Bridge, I would recommend walking it from the Brooklyn side. Take the E (I think the A also works) to High Street and treat yourself to a piece of pizza. You will likely see a long line for Grimaldi&#39s, but to avoid the hype and get pizza just as good, go for Juliana&#39s right next door which was opened by the original owners of the Grimaldi&#39s. Make sure you look up specific directions for the bridge - the pedestrian entrance can be a little hard to find.</p>
