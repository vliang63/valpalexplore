	  	  	<h2>Neighborhood Lowdown</h2>
	  	      <p>This is the neighborhood that truly has it all. Southeast enough to be close to the bars in LES, but not south enough that you&#39re mingling with the NYU students, Flatiron is also located relatively close to the Meatpacking party scene. Its lucky inhabitants are close to a Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and multiple subway lines. The shops are uniquely housed in old buildings and tons of casual restaurants to try out too.</p>

  	  	      <p>A fun trip to Europe, Eataly is a market that stocks up on all the goods you could ever want from Italy. It&#39s multiple restaurants housed inside vary from a fancy fish and steak sit down to made-to-order charcuterie boards. La Bierreria, its rooftop Eatery, offers good beer and a view of the Empire State Building.</p>

Even clubs are not really your scene, I would recommend going to the the outdoor portion just to have a look at the breathtaking night view, especially since you&#39ll be there in summer!</p>

  	  	      <p>A cozy and nice local park, perfect for a relaxing afternoon on a beautiful day. If you want to try a famous ShakeShack burger, you can do it here. Lines are long as usual, to the extent (and this isn&#39t verified!) that I heard there is a video camera of the line, which live streams on the web so you can go during periods of less rush.</p>
