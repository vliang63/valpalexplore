	  	  	<h2>Neighborhood Lowdown</h2>
	  	      <p>While New York&#39s Financial District is probably best known for the tall skyscrapers that dominate New York&#39s Skyline, it&#39s actually the multitude of corporations housed in Midtown East that comprise most of the head-turning buildings. In fact, even most financial institutions no longer operate out of FiDi but instead have offices here. While its a little more sterile than other NYC neighborhoods, most first year corporate workers will move here straight out of college to be close to work, which lends to some of the nightlife here.</p>

  	  	      <p>Affectionately known as Bro J&#39s, this is where you&#39ll have your true American cultural experiences. It&#39s packed with ex-Frat Bros straight out of college, and they are attracted to Bro J&#39s massive portions of mediocre Southern food and cheap, cheap pitchers of beer like bees to honey. There&#39s also something called the Fish Bowl (see the picture) which I&#39ve never tried, but it pretty much looks like the most effective way to get a hangover ever.</p>

  	  	      <p>A stunning rooftop view that is just as good in the day time as it is at night. They don&#39t do a full lunch up here in the daytime (only appetizers), but it tends to get pretty packed at night. </p>

  	  	      <p>My favorite park in the whole city. Bryant Park provides a striking juxtaposition of nature and city. The openness of the space is highlighted by the surrounding skyscrapers, yet the size is small enough that it feels like an intimate suburbian park.
