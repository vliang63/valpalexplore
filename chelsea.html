	  	      <p>Commonly known as one of the best situated neighborhoods (similar to Flatiron), Chelsea is walking distance to a lot of cool places, but I wouldn&#39t say that there is anything in particular that would characterize the vibe of this neighborhood, as it draws mainly on its adjacent fellows (Union Square, West Village, etc.).</p>

  	  	      <p>An old cargo ship that is attached to the land and has been converted into a bar. That sounds lame, but is actually a beautiful way to spend a sunny day - out on the water with a couple of drinks, good company, and some snacks! It&#39s one of my favorite places in the summertime, as well as the rest of New York&#39s (watch out for long lines on hot days).</p>

  	  	      <p>LThis used to be the railway that connected the meatpacking to the pier. Instead of razing it, they built a park around the old railing (and I guess raised it?) so that you can walk down a good portion of the Hudson in a one-of-a-kind park. If you get hungry or are craving a drink, there is a cute cafe located right in the middle of the park.</p>
