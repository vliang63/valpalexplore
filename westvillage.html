	  	      <p>Hands down my favorite neighborhood in Manhattan. The beautiful brownstones line up on the side of the streets and are adorned with trees on trees - something you'll find that is rare and valuable in NYC. There are still small cobblestone streets, which make the space feel intimate even though you are in the heart of one of the largest cities.</p>
